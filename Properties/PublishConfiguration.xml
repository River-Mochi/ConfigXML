**Config-XML**

- This mod potentially allows for virtually any change to Service buildings.
- At the moment, it mainly increases number of workers in Services buildings and other small adjustments (see below for details).
- You could just install it as-is with no custom edits.
- Think of this mod as a simple text-like file that players can edit (or not since a nice preset file is included).
- Prefab info is applied before any city is loaded, so no game system required (means essentially no performance impact).

Number of **preset** buildings and extensions: **222**.

### Quick-Start

- ✅ Just select "PRESETS" and done.
- Curated presets increase the **number of workers** and other small adjustments (details below).
- Wages are scaled up/down (game senses worker change and auto adjusts).

### Details - Curated Presets
- All buildings have more workers. Required education level for jobs is adjusted in 'some' buildings, and other allowed tweaks.
- Presets design: some have only a few more workers, and some have many.
- Better utilize large buildings that previously had few workers, and may help reduce unemployment.
- Example: University is normally 170 workers, this mod preset increases it to 400 as this is a big campus for 15,000 students.
- Rebuild existing buildings to see new config changes.
- Add these companion mods to also <a href="https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/123887/Windows">Increase Students</a> or <a href="https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/123738/Windows">Transit Passengers</a>
- See Power Users if you want to adjust the presets yourself.

### Power Users
- Easily tweak all player adjustable config file as you wish.
- ✅ Open Options > Custom > [Open Config folder] to create a customizable Config.xml file.
- Refer to info / examples in Config.xml for how to add / alter components (edit with Notepad++ or similar).
- New changes can be "Applied" even during the game without a restart (options menu).

### Notes

- DLC entries only work if you own the DLC and can plop the items.
- Safety: mod does **not** modify save files or any game systems.
- Can be removed at any time - already plopped buildings retain modded values and new buildings will have vanilla values.
- Performance: this is a lightweight configuration mod. It only does a short pass when applying settings (on game load or when you click APPLY).
It does not add any per-frame systems, so it essentially has no impact on performance.
- Works with mods: Adjust School, Adjust Transit, <a href="https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/125343/Windows">Magic Mail</a>, <a href="https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/124159/Windows">Magic Garbage</a>, as this mod is focused on the number of workers and those do not.
- <a href="https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/123497/Windows">Magic Hearse</a> and <a href="https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/121256/Windows">Achievement Fixer</a> also works with this.
- Pretty much any mod that doesn't also adjust worker numbers should be good.
- Technically, this mod allows for virtually any changes to Service buildings. At the moment, it mainly increases number of workers
  in Services buildings and other small adjustments. I encourage contribution to the mod and PRs on GitHub to expand the mod config abilities.
