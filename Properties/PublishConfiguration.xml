	<LongDescription>**City Services Redux** aka RealCity

Tweak and modify City Service buildings to your liking. By default, you could just install this mod and use it as-is with no configuration.

### Quick-Start
- Just select "PRESETS" and play, done.
- Curated preset list increases the number of workers and a few other small adjustments (details below). 
- Increased workers automatically increases the wages (scaled by the game itself).
- New settings are only applied to **new** buildings.

Number of **preset** buildings and extensions: **221**.

### Curated Presets
* All buildings have more workplaces, some have required education levels adjusted, and other allowed tweaks.
* Presets are designed with various considerations. Some have only slightly more workers (2), and some have many.
* Examples: University is 170 workers, preset increases this to 400 as this large building campus.
* Crematorium has 2x higher processing rate to handle increased deaths from Population Rebalance.
* Existing buildings need to be destroyed and plopped again to see new changes.
* If you want more than preset numbers, then see Power users.


### Power Users
- Easily tweak all player adjustable config file as you wish.
- Open mod Options > Custom > [Open Config folder] to create a Config.xml file you can customize.
- Refer to info / examples in Config.xml for how to add / alter components (edit with Notepad++ or similar).
- New changes can be "Applied" even during the game (use options menu).

### Notes

* DLC entries only work if you own the DLC and can plop the items.
* Safety: mod does **not** modify save files or any game systems.
* Can be removed at any time - already plopped buildings retain modded values and new buildings will have vanilla values.
* Performance: this is a lightweight configuration mod. It only does a short pass when applying settings (on game load or when you click APPLY).
It does not add any per-frame systems, so it essentially has no impact on performance.
* Works with mods: Adjust School, Adjust Transit, Magic Mail, Magic Garbage Truck, as this mod is focused on the number of workers and those do not.
* Magic Hearse and Achievement Fixer also works with this. Pretty much any mod that doesn't adjust worker numbers should be good.
