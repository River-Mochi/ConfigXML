	<LongDescription>**City Services Redux**

Tweak and modify City Service buildings to your liking. By default, you could just install this mod and use it as-is with no configuration.

### Quick-Start
- Just select "PRESETS" and play, done.
- Curated preset list increases the number of workers and a few other small adjustments (details below). 
- Wages are scaled up/down based on the number of workers automatically by the game itself (we just tweak worker counts).
- New settings are only applied to **new** placed buildings.

Number of **preset** buildings and extensions: **221**.

### Curated Presets
* All buildings have more workplaces. The required education level for the job is also adjusted in 'some' buildings, and other allowed tweaks.
* Presets are designed with various considerations. Some have only slightly more workers (2), and some have many. 
This better utilizes large buildings that previously had few workers, and may help reduce unemployment.
* Examples: University is normally 170 workers, this mod preset increases it to 400 as this is a big campus for 15,000 students. Crematorium has 2x higher processing rate.
* Existing buildings need to be rebuilt to see new config changes.
* Add these companion mods to also Increase Students or Transit Passengers
* See Power Users if you want to adjust the presets yourself.

### Power Users
- Easily tweak all player adjustable config file as you wish.
- Open mod Options > Custom > [Open Config folder] to create a Config.xml file you can customize.
- Refer to info / examples in Config.xml for how to add / alter components (edit with Notepad++ or similar).
- New changes can be "Applied" even during the game (use options menu).

### Notes

* DLC entries only work if you own the DLC and can plop the items.
* Safety: mod does **not** modify save files or any game systems.
* Can be removed at any time - already plopped buildings retain modded values and new buildings will have vanilla values.
* Performance: this is a lightweight configuration mod. It only does a short pass when applying settings (on game load or when you click APPLY).
It does not add any per-frame systems, so it essentially has no impact on performance.
* Works with mods: Adjust School, Adjust Transit, Magic Mail, Magic Garbage Truck, as this mod is focused on the number of workers and those do not.
* Magic Hearse and Achievement Fixer also works with this. Pretty much any mod that doesn't also adjust worker numbers should be good.
